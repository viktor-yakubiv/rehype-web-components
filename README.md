## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin
that transforms custom elements with templates
loaded from specified directories.
Also, it substitutes slots according to the spec,
interpolates host attributes in the template
and executes basic setup scripts prior to interpolation.

**unified** is a project that transforms content
with abstract syntax treesÂ (ASTs).
**rehype** adds support for HTML to unified.
**hast** is the HTML AST that rehype uses.
This is a rehype plugin that runs PostCSS on `<style>` elements
and other elements that have aÂ `style` attribute.

## When should I use this?

When you cannot fit your HTML development into a single file
and want to split it up to logical components;
when you still want to stick to bare HTML and its specs
rather then going far to custom syntax of a template engine.

When you want Svelte features like value interpolation and style scoping
but want to keep the project without client scripts.

When you want web components but with semantics and no JavaScript again.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-postcss
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import rehypeComponents from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-postcss@0.1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeComponents from 'https://esm.sh/rehype-postcss@6?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following file `example.html`:

```html
<my-component>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</my-component>
```

along with `components/my-component.html`:

```html
<h1><slot></slot></h1>
```

And our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import { read } from 'to-vfile'
import { rehype } from 'rehype'
import rehypeComponents from 'rehype-postcss'

const file = await rehype()
  .data('settings', { fragment: true })
  .use(rehypeComponents, {
    paths: ['components'],
  })
  .process(await read('example.html'))

console.log(String(file))
```

Now, running `node example.js` yields:

```html
<h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
```

## API

The default export is `rehypeComponents`.
